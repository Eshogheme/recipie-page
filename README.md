### What I learned

This project was undertaken to enhance my understanding of Tailwind CSS and its wide range of features. It allowed me to explore the utility-first framework and how it simplifies styling in modern web development. Through hands-on experience, I was able to experiment with responsive design, custom themes, and component-based styling. This project provided valuable insights into efficiently building scalable and maintainable user interfaces.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: newFont;
  src: url("../assets/fonts/outfit/static/Outfit-Medium.ttf");
}
```

### Useful resources
